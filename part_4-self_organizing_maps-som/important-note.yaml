  For all those following this course and implementing the code on Google Colab, please create a copy of this Google Colab, upload the dataset and delete the code cells to write your own code. You don't need to put the minisom.py file; instead, you can simply run "pip install MiniSom".

  Thanks again @Nirav!

  Enjoy Deep Learning!
