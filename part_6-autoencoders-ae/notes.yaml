Building Stack Autoencoder:
  - Possible Improvements:
      - Number of neurons:
          - "self.fc1 = nn.Linear(nb_movies, 20)"
          - 20 were chosen but could be modified for better results
      - Activation Function:
          - "self.activation = nn.Sigmoid()"
          - Utilised sigmoid of rectifier, however another one could be chosen to improve the model
      - Optimizer:
        - "optimizer = optim.RMSprop(sae.parameters(), lr = 0.01, weight_decay = 0.5)"
        - RMSprop was chosen over Adadm
        - Learning rate (lr) can be optimised
        - weight_decay can be optimised
    - Epochs:
          - "nb_epoch = 200"
          - Could be optimised
